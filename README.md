>Your answer is saved in an array and we use your input to match with someone based on the answers you provide. 

# Issues
>The main issue was working within so many files. They all had to interact with each other and it was complicated at first but I figured it out. Also, some of the photo links made the photos look huge so I had to find different photos.
I hope you have fun.
